# Learn Ruby FFI

My goal is to learn how to use the Ruby FFI gem to call C code from Ruby. This includes learning all of the concepts in the [ffi wiki](https://github.com/ffi/ffi/wiki) with the end goal of being able to write Ruby wrappers for advanced C libraries like [libyara](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/capi.html).
